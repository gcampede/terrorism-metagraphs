### Functions




'''This function first divides a given dataset into two-day slices (u=2t). 

The chunkSize argument can be modified based on the use case: in this 

experiments we have set a chunkSize = 2. Default is 3'''


def split(df, chunkSize = 3):
    
    numberChunks = len(df) // chunkSize + 1
    
    return np.array_split(df, numberChunks, axis=0)




''' This function multiplies the transpose of the two-mode matrix (2t x features)

by the original matrix, obtaining a new square matrix (features x features)'''
    


def sq_mul(df):
    
    df_trans=df.T
    
    sqr_df=df_trans.dot(df)
    
    return(sqr_df)




    
''' This function takes as input the centrality values stored in 

a dictionary to normalize them by dividing each value in each u 

by the max value in that same dictionary, so that the highest 

centrality will become equal to 1 and all the others will be bounded in the

[0,0.999] interval '''


def normalize(dict):
    
    m=max(dict.values()) if dict.values() else 0
    
    dict.update({n:dict[n]/max(dict.values()) for n in dict.keys()})
    
    return(dict)


''' Finally, this function uses networkx to calculate centrality values of each 

temporal meta-graph, and exploits the normalize(dict) function to compute

normalized values'''
